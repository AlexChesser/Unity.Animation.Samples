# Unity.Animation.Samples

This repository contains projects that showcase the new DOTS animation package (com.unity.animation).
- [HDRP samples](UnityAnimationHDRPExamples/README.md).
- [URP samples](UnityAnimationURPExamples/README.md).


## Disclaimer

This version is highly experimental. We want you to know it's there, we invite you to peek at it and consider what it might mean for you and the future of Unity. What we don't want you to do is to rely on it as if it's something ready for professional production.
- Will work on 2020.1.2f1 and up.
- HDRP/URP GPU skinning only.
- Not (yet!) for production use.
- Early picture of what the DOTS animation system, might not be representative of the final version.
- You will need to be tech savvy to use this version. Not yet ready for everyone.
- Core system only, many animation tools are missing.
- Expect things to change.
